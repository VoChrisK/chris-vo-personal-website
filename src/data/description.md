When I was thirteen years old, I was introduced to programming through ROBLOX, a massively-multiplayer online video game and game creation platform. By immersing myself in game development and programming with Lua, I was able to develop a game that was fairly popular at the time: Amusement BLOX. This game is an amusement park with a variety of rides and minigames and it was played by users over 50,000 times. Thus, was still a monumental achievement to me because it got me interested in software engineering.

Fast forward to present time, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics at San Jose State University, and completed a full stack web development bootcamp: App Academy. I enjoy building new things and solving logical problems programatically. I also enjoy working collaboratively with other developers to implement solutions to wide-scale problems. Most importantly, I always strive to learn new things, whether it's related to this field or my hobbies, and I enjoy every second of it! I am currently in a team in Fidelity Investments where I work on building and testing features for Fidelity's Guided Retirement Experience app.

At this time, I am not looking for new opportunities. However, my inbox is open for any questions or comments. Feel free to shoot me an email in that case and I'll get back to you ASAP!
